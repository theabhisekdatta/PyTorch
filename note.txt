    -- In PyTorch everything is based on Tensor operations (Just like Numpy array)
    -- Tensor have more dimensions, 1D, 2D, 3D and more dimensions.
    -- In PyTorch every function having trailing underscore will do inplace operations.
    -- Basic operations Add, Sub, Mul and Div
    -- Slicing operations like List and Numpy
    -- .items() for printing elements
    -- Reshaping the tensors .view()
    -- Numpy to torch tensor
